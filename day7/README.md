# 🟢 JavaScript Mini Projects – Lab

This lab combines **4 simple projects** in a single exercise.  
Each project focuses on using **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** to practice **DOM manipulation, events, and UI updates**.

---

## 📌 Project 1: Add Items to a List

**Objective:**  
Learn how to read user input and create new elements dynamically.

**Task:**

- Create an input box and an “Add” button.
- When the user types text and clicks the button, the text is added to a list.
- The input should be cleared after each entry.

**Concepts practiced:**

- `input.value` to get user input.
- `document.createElement("li")` and `appendChild()` to create and insert elements.
- Resetting input values.

## 📌 Project 2: Random Background Color

**Objective:**  
Learn how to change CSS styles dynamically with JavaScript.

**Task:**

- Create a button.
- When clicked, the page background changes to a random color from a predefined set.

**Concepts practiced:**

- Arrays to store multiple values.
- `Math.random()` for random selection.
- Changing styles with `document.body.style.backgroundColor`.

---

## 📌 Project 3: Simple Image Toggle

**Objective:**  
Learn how to switch between different values (toggle) in the DOM.

**Task:**

- Show an image and a button.
- Each time the button is clicked, the image changes to another one.
- The images keep toggling back and forth.

**Concepts practiced:**

- Storing image URLs in an array.
- Updating attributes with `img.src`.
- Using a variable (index) to track current state.

## 📌 Project 4: Mini Counter with + / – Buttons

**Objective:**  
Learn how to update text content dynamically based on user actions.

**Task:**

- Show a number on the screen with two buttons: “+” and “–”.
- Clicking “+” increases the number.
- Clicking “–” decreases the number.

**Concepts practiced:**

- Variables (`let count = 0;`) to store state.
- Updating content with `innerText`.
- Event listeners for button clicks.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

By completing these 4 projects, students will practice:

- Reading and handling user input.
- Creating, updating, and manipulating DOM elements.
- Using arrays and generating random values.
- Handling events with `addEventListener`.
- Updating the user interface interactively.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

- Each project can be written in a separate HTML file or combined into one.
- Open the file(s) in a browser and interact with the elements.
- Try experimenting by adding new features (e.g., delete list items, add more colors, toggle more than 2 images, prevent negative counter values).
